        <h3>Financially Free</h3>
        <p>I want to get to a stage where i am completely free financially, enabling me to learn more about life, myself, travel, and doing things for others</p>
        <p>I also would love to give back to those who are in much less fortunate positions than myself, so being finacially free and having enough resources to help those in need would make my dream come true.</p>
        <h3>Pass my ISTQB exam!!</h3>
        <p>This has to be one of my most biggest and hardest challenges. I dont know what it is but this course is not like anything ive ever done, which makes it even more challenging.</p>
        <p>Passing this would deem me a comptent and qualified software tester, which is something I want to achieve for my long term goal in the technology industry and my future career path.</p>
