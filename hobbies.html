        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p>I regularly take part in both 5 a-side and 7 a-side football, both with friends and at a competeitvie level, competing at sunday league level. This has helped boost my confience and allowed me to showcase my coomunication and leadership skills.</p>
        <p>Also because i absolutely love this sport :p</p>
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite past times. Super relaxing and i recommend anyone who doesn't know how to swim, TO LEARN!!/p>
        <h3>MMA/Jujitsu</h3>
        <p>I am currently a yellow belt and hope to move up in rank soon within the next few months.</p>
        <p>Absolutely recommend this to anyone who is interested in keeping fit, or just learning something new about your body/weight class in general.</p>
